 A semi-profession is an occupation that requires advanced knowledge and skills but is not widely regarded as a true profession. Traditional examples of semi-profession include social works, journalism, librarianship, teaching, and nursing.</p>

<p>Such &quot;fields often have less clear-out barriers to entry than traditional profession like low and medicine, and their practitioners often lack the degree of control over their own work that has been traditionally associated with professionals such as doctors and lawyers.


<p>In&shy; additional, semi-profession tend to have been historically identified as “women’s work”, which has exacerbated prejudices against regarding them as “true” profession regardless of the amount of skill involved. In most semi-profession fields, efforts at professionalization are ongoing.</p>


Teaching is also referred as a semi-profession because it has entailed a lot of semi-skills which one can do in day to day life but cannot be referred to as a true profession. Examples of education fields is English Literature. One can possibly be a journalism, because of the qualification that is common in both sides.


TEACHING IS A SEMI-PROFESSION BECAUSE IT HAS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS:

Lower in occupational status or downward status.

Shorter training periods: Because teaching as a semi-profession was historically identified as “women’s work” hence women obtain fewer resources and shorter training periods.

Lack of societal acceptance that the nature of the service or the level of expertise justifies the anatomy that is granted to the professions.
